# Counting-Sea-Lions-and-Elephants-from-Aerial-Photography-using-Deep-Learning-with-Density-Maps
We have trained two deep learning models, a basic UNet without any feature extractor (Model-1), and another with the EfficientNet-B5 feature extractor (Model-2). We measured the model's prediction accuracy using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the predicted and actual animal count. The results showed that we were able to achieve an RMSE of 1.88 and 0.60 for counting Steller sea lions and African elephants respectively, regardless of the complex background, the different illumination conditions and the heavy overlapping and occlusion of the animals.
