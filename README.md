# Counting-Sea-Lions-and-Elephants-from-Aerial-Photography-using-Deep-Learning-with-Density-Maps
The ability to automatically count animals is important for designing appropriate environmental policies and for monitoring their populations, in relation to biodiversity and maintaining balances among species. Out of all living mammals on Earth, 60% are livestock, 36% humans, and only 4% are animals that live in the wild. In a relatively short period, human development of civilization caused a loss of 83% of all wildlife and 50% of all plants. The rate of species' extinction is accelerating. Traditional wildlife surveys provide rough population estimates. However, emerging technologies such as aerial photography allow to perform large-scale surveys in short time and high accuracy. In this paper, we propose the use of computer vision, through a deep learning (DL) architecture, together with aerial photography and density maps, to count the population of Steller sea lions and African elephants with high precision.
